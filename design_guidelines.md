# Milsoy Yapı - Luxury Construction Portfolio Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based:** High-end architectural agency aesthetic combining premium portfolio sites (similar to luxury architecture firms) with construction industry credibility. Think Zaha Hadid Architects meets modern construction excellence.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Dark Luxury:** Deep sophistication through contrast and restraint
2. **Craftsmanship Focus:** Every detail reinforces quality and precision
3. **Trust Through Grandeur:** Spacious layouts communicate confidence and expertise

- **Accent Gold:** Metallic gold (#D4AF37) for CTAs, borders, icons, and highlights
- **Text:** White/off-white for primary content, muted grays for secondary

## Typography System
- **Headlines:** Extra large, bold weights (64-80px desktop, 36-48px mobile) - commanding presence
- **Subheadings:** 32-40px desktop, clean sans-serif
- **Body:** 18-20px for readability, generous line-height (1.7-1.8)
- **Font Stack:** Modern geometric sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Montserrat) for premium feel

## Layout & Spacing
